# PowerShell

This folder contains PowerShell scripts related to Microsoft O365 account maintenance. Feel free to use and adjust to your needs. FYI some of the commands may require specific admin permissions, so if you don't have those permissions, some of the commands may not work.

This usually goes without saying, but TEST FIRST before using in production! There may be bugs or caveats that do not fit your needs. I'm not responsible for breaking your system if you don't test to figure out what works and what doesn't!
